# Testing and Email Workflow Enhancement

This update implements comprehensive testing and email notification capabilities for the AiFoodApp project.

## 🚀 Features Implemented

### Automated Testing Workflow
- **Comprehensive test suite**: 15 unit tests covering core services
- **Automated execution**: Tests run on every push to master branch
- **Multiple test types**: Service layer unit tests with mocking
- **Professional reporting**: XML and TXT test reports generated

### Email Notifications
- **Beautiful HTML emails** with test results summary
- **Professional styling** with tables and color coding
- **GitHub integration** with direct links to commits and workflow runs
- **Comprehensive metrics**: Test counts, timing, pass/fail status
- **Attachment support**: Test reports and logs attached to emails

### Test Coverage

#### UserServiceTest (8 tests)
- Email-based user lookup (positive/negative cases)
- ID-based user lookup (positive/negative cases)  
- Null parameter handling
- Exception handling and logging

#### RecipeServiceTest (7 tests)
- CRUD operations (save, update, list, findById)
- Exception scenarios (not found cases)
- Repository interaction verification

## 🔧 Technical Improvements

### Configuration Fixes
- **Java version standardization**: Updated to Java 17 across all files
- **Workflow bug fixes**: Fixed step references and error handling
- **Dependency updates**: Added Spring Security Test support

### Workflow Configuration
The email workflow (`test-and-email.yml`) includes:
- Automated test execution with Maven
- Test result parsing from Surefire XML reports
- Professional HTML email generation
- Error handling for failed builds
- Timing and duration tracking

## 📊 Current Status

```
✅ Tests run: 15, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0
✅ Build: SUCCESS  
✅ Email: Configured and ready
✅ Workflow: Fixed and operational
```

## 🏗️ Next Steps

The foundation is now in place for:
- Adding more integration tests for controllers
- Expanding service test coverage
- Adding performance testing
- Implementing code coverage reporting

## 📧 Email Configuration

The workflow requires these GitHub secrets to be configured:
- `MAIL_USERNAME`: SMTP username (Gmail account)
- `MAIL_PASSWORD`: SMTP password (App password for Gmail)
- `MAIL_RECIPIENT`: Email address to receive notifications

When properly configured, the workflow will send beautiful HTML emails with comprehensive test results and GitHub integration links.
